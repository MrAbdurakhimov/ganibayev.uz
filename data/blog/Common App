## Introduction

The Common Application is an online platform that allows you to apply to multiple colleges at once. The Common App streamlines the college application process by allowing students to fill out details such as their contact information, extracurricular activities, grades, and essays just one time. It's the most popular college application platform, and more than a million students use it each year.
Using the Common App is free for students, though you’ll likely have to pay application fees for the schools you're applying to. If you're worried about these costs, you can apply for a fee waiver.) Over 900 colleges use the Common App, so there's a high chance that all the schools you're applying to allow Common App submissions.
The big benefit to using the Common App is that you can apply to schools through a centralized college application system instead of having to submit all your applications individually. This type of system not only makes the whole college application process a lot easier, but it also saves you a ton of valuable time since you won’t have to keep filling out the same information for each school.
