## Introduction
IELTS journey has not been the longest but seemed so. I was in Tashkent (far from my family) for the whole 7 months. Expectations about the score about the were higher, dreams to rest after the exam were bigger, but no one knows about the fate. Although, I was not able to get what I wanted, I still have done a wonderful job and proud of myself. I set clearer goals, made thorough plans and started the process called "Hard-Work".
